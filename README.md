# AI Web Scraper 🕷️🤖

I just built this **AI Web Scraper** because I saw this *super cool* YouTube video by **Tech With Tim** (shoutout to him! 👏). It’s like magic—scraping websites and extracting info using AI! 🤯

Check out the original project here: [Tech With Tim's GitHub](https://github.com/techwithtim/AI-Web-Scraper.git)  
And here’s my version: [Shift118's GitHub](https://github.com/Shift118/AI-Web-Scraper.git) 🚀

## What does it do? 🤔

- **Scrapes websites** like a pro 🕸️  
- **Cleans up the messy HTML** (bye-bye, scripts and styles! ✨)  
- **Uses AI** to extract *exactly* what you’re looking for 🤖  
- **Super easy to use** with a fancy Streamlit interface 🖥️
